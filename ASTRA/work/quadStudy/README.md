# Study of imperfections for triplet

This study was about running rays through imperfect system with 3 quadrupole magnets. In every case, I varied only 1 imperfection at a time and looked at the final position at the end screen for 2 rays. One with 0 initial offset and angle in x direction, the other with 0 offset and angle in y direction. Initially, I ran this for 3 different D1: 10, 20, 30 cm. The plots for each imperfection are in the respective directories. The left plot is for ray in x direction and it's x and y final offset, the right plot is for the ray with y initial divergence. 
In the next part, I wanted to systematically study these offsets for many different D1 and Pz. Instead of making plots, I decided to fit both slopes for both rays, therefore for study of 1 imperfection for a solution with a specific D1, Pz, there are 4 results of fits. Analytically, these slopes are the partial derivatives of parameter R22 (or R44) w.r.t. to the specific offset. I ran the study but I never processed the data and got some kind of output. I cannot quarantee the quality of the fits, but I do not see why there should be a mistake somewhere there. It would be interesting to see quantitatively that the transverse offsets of quadrupoles have the most effect. All the data are stored in data_fitting.
